The WinWaker file: 
Fire Temple is in the Hyrule Castle grotto

TODO: 
Make ZL easier to obtain
Modify 0296 to spawn you in Castle Courtyard Day always
Implement better reward for defeating "Heaven" (ZL, min 5 chus every respawn)
Secondary one time spawn in Windmill is part of shuffled entrances. (fixing)


Fix fatal crash when dying in prerendered areas (no health while entering outside temple of time) [FIXED]

Make Rescuing Sages repeatable (pending testing)
Add fix for warping into Nabooru Knuckle with song

FATAL GLITCH: 
RC 01:
Entered Fire Temple normally, filename WinWaker (cannot reproduce)
Enter Master Sword chamber while triggering first getting ms cs, fall oobs (pending testing)

Implemented:
 * Added a special mode where entrances are are constantly being shuffled. To play this 
	mode, set your filename to "RNG-Only", case specific.
 * Added a special check to prevent wrong warps, as they cannot be safely randomized. 
	Attempting to wrong warp will ruin your game. 
	Note: Cutscene skips should not be affected (Forest/Water/Shadow/Spirit medallions,
	warp songs, etc.)
 * Shortened several key quest cutscenes. A side effect of this is that you can no longer
	BA off of the Light Arrow cs.
 * Entrances that crash as a Child or Adult have been tweaked to not crash. As a result,
	all dungeons can be beaten as a child
 * The Nabooru Knuckle fight now also triggers as a child, preventing you from becoming
	trapped in the room.
 * Individual Generic and Fairy Fountain grotto entrances are randomized. Each location
	will lead to a unique spawn.
 * Added a secret area that can only be reached by entering a grotto. It will disappear
	once you open the chest at the end.
	Note: Although the possibility is very small, beating the secret area may be mandatory
	for beating the game.
 * Until you obtain magic, Great Fairy Fountains will always take you to the magic one.
	The Magic Great Fairy Fountain's exit will depend on the initial entrance used
 * Ganon's Castle (outside area) spawns tweaked to keep you in bounds
 * All of Tower Collapse's temporary events (except for the collapse cutscene itself) have
	been made permanent
 * Applied hack to reduce pause lag. This hack results in a trippy graphical effect when 
	pausing or getting game over.
 * Farore's Wind restore points are retained when going through time 
 * Song of Time door will now open when spawning from all entrances
 * Imported 1.2's Kakariko Graveyard to eliminate sticky graves 


Won't:
Randomize Lost Woods... bleh
start with default equipment (sword, shield, bombs, ocarina)
then you are less likely to get stuck, and if you do get stuck, just kill yourself with bombs

Don't reset Farore's Wind hack: (80053254/AC91B4, Change AC600E80 to 00000000)

Don't randomize when scene setup > 3


Entering a grotto has special behaviour: 
036D
003F

Entering Fairy Fountains will behave differently

Entering: 
Check post randomization...
	if entering fairy fountain (fixed table index 0-4). 0x315 case handles itself
	if Save + 0x3A == 0. 
		true? set entrance index to 0x315

Exiting:
Check Pre-Randomization/Post random table index lookup...
	if randomized exit = 0x045B
	if Save + 0x3A == 0.
	if previous entrance was 0x315
		true? use fixed table index 0-4 to determine exit destination. Keep exit if index > 4

* When the dog is given up, we want to spawn at a specific entrance, regardless of randomization
